# Brhythm
ðŸŽµ _Your best rhythm starts from here ..._

A carefully crafted music streaming platform back-end API, powered by Node.JS and Microsoft 365.

## TL;DR
An all-in-one solution for individuals or organisations to upload, manage, stream music in a cost-effective way, but still be able to enjoy functionalities that are comparable to commercial platforms.

## Getting Started
### Recipe
1. A computing device that is capable of running Node.JS runtime environment
2. A domain name with corresponding SSL certificate configured
3. A relational database (preferably PostgreSQL) with appropriate access detail ready
4. A Redis database with appropriate access detail ready
5. An Azure Active Directory ADMIN (or global admin) account and configure it as follows:
   1. Create a new App Registration and configure the Redirect URI (choose "Web" for platform) as https://URL_TO_YOUR_BACKEND/auth/callback
   2. Go to "Certificates & secrets" section, add a new "Client secret" with desired expiry length
   3. Copy the value of the created secret and paste to a text file
   4. Go to "API permissions" section, add following permissions:
      - Microsoft Graph --> Delegated permissions --> OpenId permissions --> tick "email" and "profile" --> click "Add permissions" button
      - Microsoft Graph --> Application permissions --> Files --> tick "Files.ReadWrite.All" --> click "Add permissions" button
      - Microsoft Graph --> Application permissions --> User --> tick "User.Read.All" --> click "Add permissions" button
   5. Click "Grant admin consent for ..." and confirm
6. A compatible front-end web user interface _(official front-end SPA will be released soon)_
7. (Optional, for fetching album cover arts) A valid Last.FM API key, acquired from Last.FM developer portal

### Install
1. Clone this repository
2. Run following commands to install dependencies:
   ```
   $ cd brhythm
   $ npm ci
   ```
3. Use your preferred text editor to fill in all the required configurations in `.env.sample` file
4. Rename `.env.sample` file to `.env`
5. Make sure you have properly configured firewalls and/or security groups so that inbound traffic is not dropped
6. Start the Node.JS instance by invoking:
   ```
   # Option 1: Not recommended
   $ npm start

   # Option 2: Preferred (if pm2 module is installed)
   $ pm2 start --name brhythm-api ./bin/www
   ## Run the instance automatically after server reboots
   $ pm2 startup
   $ pm2 save
   ```
7. Ready to go ~
